# A Procedural City Demo
A procedural generation demo of a city in Unity.

City building is one of my favorite genres, so I decided to experiment with a procedurally generated city. While there are a lot of basic tutorials out there, nothing really matched what I had in mind, so I got into the mathematics of procedural generation and Unity engine documentation. I chose to use the Unity game engine because of readily available documentation and ease of scripting with C#.
